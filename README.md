# K-Nearest Neighbor Classification Practice

This repository contains an implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm using the Iris dataset. The project focuses on classifying iris flowers based on their features.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features)
- **Goal:** Classify iris species into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
- **Model:** k-NN classifier

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Key Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- k-NN classification
- Model evaluation with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Results

The script outputs the model's accuracy and visualizes the confusion matrix.
